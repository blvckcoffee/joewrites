# Hello

#### I'm Joe, a technical and UX writer.

I've been writing professionally since 2011 in a variety of industries including formal education, specialty coffee, and artificial intelligence.

Most recently, I've been working on the Product Education team at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/).

I love learning new things and making sense of messes. Technology can be frustrating. I clarify content so that people can succeed with technology. I'm a descriptive writer and a prescriptive editor. I use the Oxford comma and the [interrobang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang). I believe that all companies should have more educators in their ranks to help break the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge).

In my spare time, you'll find me reading, running in the woods, and building for the web with the [jamstack](https://jamstack.wtf/).

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-johnson-dev/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/blvckcoffee).
